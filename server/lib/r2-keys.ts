/**
 * Single source of truth for every R2 object key in the PHOTOS bucket.
 * Root is always `{tenantId}/` so per-tenant list/meter/purge is one prefix.
 * Object id is a stable `{mediaId}` (UUID), NEVER `{itemId}` — photos move
 * between items via the DB, so the key must not encode item membership.
 * Add a builder here rather than forming a key string inline anywhere else.
 *
 * -- THE ONE EXCEPTION, AND WHY IT IS ONE ------------------------------------
 * `statutoryFormSource` is the only key here that does NOT begin with
 * `{tenantId}/`. What it addresses is an authority's own published PDF: the
 * same bytes of the same state government document, identical for every
 * workspace that renders that form.
 *
 * Storing it per tenant would copy one state form N times, and -- the part that
 * actually bites -- a tenant-level purge would delete it. Deleting a workspace
 * would then quietly remove the substrate every OTHER workspace renders that
 * form from, and the failure would surface much later as a form that cannot be
 * produced, with nothing connecting it to the deletion.
 *
 * It is placed under `_platform/` because a tenant id is a UUID and `_` is not
 * in that alphabet, so the prefix cannot collide with a real tenant root
 * (checked rather than assumed). Anything under `_platform/` is deployment
 * data, out of scope for per-tenant list, meter and purge by construction.
